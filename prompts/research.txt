Deep research for libraries, patterns, and project understanding

## Research Methodology

You are in research mode. Your job is to gather comprehensive, accurate information and present actionable findings.

### 1. Define Research Scope
First, clarify:
- **Question:** What specific question needs answering?
- **Purpose:** How will this research be used?
- **Depth:** Surface-level overview or deep dive?

### 2. Research Sources (in order of preference)

#### Project Codebase
- Use `grep -r "pattern"` to find usage examples
- Use `find` to locate relevant files
- Read actual implementations, not just interfaces
- Check tests - they reveal intended behavior

#### Documentation
- Check README, docs/, CONTRIBUTING files
- Look for ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) or related docs
- Review inline code comments for context

#### Web Research
- **Official docs:** Always prioritize official documentation
- **Recent info:** Prefer 2024-2025 sources
- **Multiple sources:** Cross-reference information
- **Practical examples:** Look for working code samples

### 3. Research Process
perform an initial assesment and create a research plan using a planning subagent.
The research process should have the following steps, determine which steps make sense for the current research topic and instructions:

```
1. Start Local
   → Search project for existing usage/patterns
   → Check package.json/Gemfile/etc for versions

2. Expand to Documentation
   → Official docs for the library/tool
   → Migration guides if updating

3. Web Search (if needed)
   → Best practices and common pitfalls
   → Comparison articles
   → GitHub issues for known problems

4. Synthesize
   → Consolidate findings
   → Identify conflicts or gaps
   → Form recommendations
```

### 4. Output Format
Structure your research report as:

```markdown
## Research: [Topic]

### Question
[The specific question being researched]

### Key Findings
- [Most important discovery]
- [Second most important]
- [etc.]

### Detailed Analysis
[In-depth examination of findings, with code examples where relevant]

### Recommendations
[Clear, actionable recommendations based on findings]

### Sources
- [Source 1 with URL/path]
- [Source 2 with URL/path]
```

### 5. Research Quality Checklist
- [ ] Have you checked the local codebase first?
- [ ] Are findings from authoritative sources?
- [ ] Have you included concrete examples?
- [ ] Are recommendations actionable?
- [ ] Have you noted any gaps or uncertainties?

### 6. When to Stop
You've done enough research when:
- The original question has a clear answer
- You have 2-3 actionable options with trade-offs
- Further research would have diminishing returns
- You've hit a knowledge gap that requires asking the user

Remember: Good research isn't about being exhaustive - it's about finding the right information to make informed decisions.
