Conversation compaction strategy. Use when you need to free context window space but keep the agent in context

You are compacting the conversation history. Summarize what we've discussed so far, keeping:
- Current task/project we're working on
- Key decisions made
- Important findings or code snippets
- What still needs to be done
- Any special instructions or constraints
{{ARGS}}

Format as a detailed summary, this will be the ONLY context the AI has after compaction.

using InnerEval tool:
* send /new to yourself and
* add the summary as the first assistant message
